 name: Stacked Column Chart
 description: Stacked column charts show data from different groups 'stacked' on top of each other. The resulting column shows the combined result of the groups and allows you to see the part vs. whole relationships between the elements of each group. To create your own, simply set the `stacked` configuration property of the `column` to `true`. The `stackTooltip` visualization adds a legend so that you can see the values of data from all groups at once.
