 name: Bar Chart with Custom Tooltip
 description: In Contour, it's easy to create your own visualizations and add them to the core Contour object. Use the `export()` function to create the new kind of visualization. Then, add this new visualization to an instance of Contour. Here we've created a custom visualization that puts the tooltip information for the bar chart at the end of the bar, rather than in a legend at the top of the visualization.
