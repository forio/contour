##Contributing

Forio Contour is offered free and open source under the {TODO, with link, pending Will} license. This license allows {TODO, summary}. (take from contour-showcase/license.html)

We chose this license in part because we want to encourage community participation in the ongoing development of Forio Contour. We're excited for you to contribute your own Contour extensions and help build our data visualization community.

How you can help:

* You can suggest improvements or report bugs using our [issue tracker](https://github.com/forio/contour/issues)
* [Fork us on GitHub](https://github.com/forio/contour/) and contribute back to the community
	* If you're new to the code base, a good way to get your feet wet is to take a look at our [tests](https://github.com/forio/contour/tree/master/tests) and critique or expand them. We use the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io) testing framework to create unit tests for most of the Contour functionality.


###Contributor's Agreement

We happily accept pull requests, however, we do ask that you sign a [Contributor License Agreement](){TODO: do we just copy /products/julia-studio/fca.html here? other changes we need to make?}. The purpose of the CLA is to assign joint copyright of the newly contributed code to both the author and to Forio. This allows Forio to later relicense the code without restricting the rights of the contributor. The agreement also contains language about patents and trademarks. It confirms that the contributor has the actual right to provide the code. Finally, if the contributor wrote the code in a job and the code is owned by the employer, the agreement confirms that the employer approves the contribution of the code to Forio Contour.
